It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery.",Pharmacology,AIIMS 2018

(Sullivan and Harris- 1958, Harris- 1963 ) 
The dental status Of children between 7 to 14 years of age residing at Hopewood House, Bowral New South Wales, was studied longitudinally for 10 years. Almost all these children had lived from early infancy at Hopewood House. 
All lived on a strictly natural diet, that, with the exception of on occasional serving of egg yolk, was entirely vegetable in nature and largely raw. The absence of meat and restriction of refined carbohydrate were the principal features of the Hopewood House diet. 
The meals were supplemented by vitamin concentrates and an occasional serving of nuts and a sweetening agent such as honey. The fluoride content of water and food was insignificant and no tea was consumed. 
TURKU SUGAR STUDY 
(Scheinin and Makinen in 975) 
The study was carried outin Turku, Finland. 
Aim Of the study 
To compare the cariogenicity of sucrose, fructose and Xylitol. 
Basis of the study 
XylitoI is a sweet substance not metabolized by plaque micro organisms.
Key Concept:
In Hopewood house study : the children's oral hygiene was poor, calculus is uncommon,  but  gingivitis  was  prevalent  in 75%  of  children. This work  showed  that,  in institutionalized  children  at  least,  dental caries  can  be  reduced  by  a  spartan  diet, without the beneficial effects of fluoride  and in the presence of unfavorable oral hygiene.

In mild preeclampsia – if gestational age is > than labour induced should be 37 wks (here in the question = gestational age is >37 weeks). Here BP is 150/100, (Therefore, it is not necessary to start antihypertensive). The NICE clinical guidelines suggest treating moderate hypertension (BP-150/100-159/109 mm Hg) with antihypertensives to keep B I P <150/80-100 range. The benefits or disadvantages of this intervention have not been elucidated by adequate clinical trials.

“There is a consensus that if BP is below 150/100 mm Hg, there is no need for antihypertensive therapy. An exception may be if mild hypertension is associated with markers of potential severe disease or sign of organ dysfunction, (heavy proteinuria, liver dysfunction, hematological dysfuntion)”.
Fernando Arias 4/e, p 209.
Thus, in this patient, the role of antihypertensive is not confirmatory as BP is 150/100 mm Hg. But role of induction of labor is confirmed, as patient is 37 weeks pregnant with mild hypertension.
PIH is not a contraindication for VBAC (Vaginal birth after cesarean) and further more that the pelvis of this patient is adequate – so there is no harm in inducing labour, rather it is advantageous, because it will help in developing lower uterine segment.

The four zones 

Zone of infection
Zone of contamination

Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

The viscosity of a pseudoplastic fluid decreases with increasing shear rate. 
The tomato-based food condiment ketchup is also pseudoplastic, which makes it difficult to remove from a bottle. Shaking the bottle or rapping the side of the bottle increases its shear rate, decreases its viscosity, and improves its pourability.

Congenital disease in diabetes mellitus
Option a i.e. Results due to free radical injury - True -
Congenital malformation in a case of diabetes can be due to variety of reasons like, Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 287

Genetic susceptibility
Hyperglycemia - It is seen that good glycemic control indicated by HbAIC levels < %.9 can significantly lower the risk of fetal malformation.
Arachidonic acid deficiency
Ketone body formation
Free Radical injury
Somatomedin inhibition.

Option b–6 to 10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality
Here we will have to read the option very carefully - the option is talking about Major congenital anomalities and not all anomalies.
Dutta Obs 6/e, p- 287 says overall incidence of congenital Malformations is 6-10%.
Williams 24/e p 1128. “The incidence of major malformations in women with type I diabetes is ~ 5%”
Hence option b is incorrect
Option c - 1 - 2% of newborns are associated with single umbilical artery
This option can be taken in + /– status because no where the incidence of single umbilical artery in a case of diabetes has been mentioned separately.
Whatever little information we have is from Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 220
Single umbilical artery:

It is present in 1-2% cases (overall)
May be due to failure of development of artery or due to its atrophy in later months
It is seen in case of

i. Twins
ii. Babies born to diabetic mothers
iii. In polyhydramines

Single umbilical artery has been associated with congenital malformations of the fetus in 10-20% cases viz- Renal & Genital anomalies and fetal Trisomy
There is increased incidence of abortions, prematurity, IUGR and increased perinatal mortality.

Option d- insulin can be given
There is no doubt as far as this option is concerned as insulin is the TOC for controlling hyperglycemia in case of diabetes in pregnancy.
So from above discussion it is clear that option ‘b’ is absolutely incorrect, so we are opting it out.",Gynaecology & Obstetrics,

The maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:

Amount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.
Direction of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.
	In most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
	However, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.
Duration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.
Frequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.

Key Concept:
According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.

Sign and symptoms of Brain tumors in children

Children with brain tumors frequently have symptoms and signs that strongly suggest the appropriate diagnosis.
The clinical triad of symptoms associated with increased ICT -4 headache, vomiting, blurred vision / diplopia, is the hallmark of brain tumors in childhood.
These symptoms occur more frequently with mid-line posterior fossa (infratentorial) tumors owing to the propensity of lesions close to the ventricular CSF flow system.
Symptoms of the brain tumors vary depending upon which part of the brain the tumor is found :­

Brain tumor in cerebrum (supratentorial)

Seizures                                 o Hemiperes is or Hemiplegia          o Drowsiness / confusion
Visual changes                     o T ICT (less common)                        o Personality changes

Brain tumor in brain stem

Seizures                                 o Diplopia             o Respiratory changes o T ICT (Rare)
Endocrine problem (DM) o Headache            o Cranial N. palsy

Brain tumor in cerebellum

T ECT (most common)     o Headache          o Uncoordinated movement
Vomiting                               o Ataxia

Symptoms due to raised ICT --> These are mainly caused by midline posterior fossa tumor --> Medulloblastoma.

Headache                                                    o Nausea                                                  o Drowsiness
Vomiting (usually in the morning)         o Personality changes                         o Papilledema
Diplopia / blurred vision                           o Irritability

Approximately 70%of individuals with hyper lgM syndrome have the X linked form of the disease , caused by mutations in the gene coding CD40L located on Xq26. In remaining patients,the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most of these patients have loss of function mutation involving either CD40 or enzyme called AID. So, B-cells can be detected by flowcytometryhaving low expression of CD40. Bruton's disease -In this disease, there is defect in B-cell tyrosine kinase enzyme. This leads to hypogammaglobulinemia.

Rheumatic fever is an acute immunologically mediated multisystem inflammatory disease that occurs few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
The disease is immune mediated, not a communicable disease.
	Epidemiology ofAcute Rheumatic fever.
The epidemiology of acute Rheumatic fever is identical to that of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.
As is the case of streptococcal sore throat, acute rheumatic fever most often occurs in children, the peak age related incidence is between 5-15 years.
Epidemiological risk factor for rheumatic fever, include lower standards of living especially crowding, the disease has been more common among socially and economically disadvantaged populations.

Pathogenesis of Rheumatic fever

It is strongly suspected that acute Rheumatic fever is a hypersensitivity reaction induced by group A streptococci but the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain despite many years of investigation.
Although the precise factor or factors that confer this property are unknown, highly rheumatogenic strains, share certain biological characteristic.
It is believed that antibodies directed against the M proteins of certain strains cross reacts with glycoprotein antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues. These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).
The M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response. These antibodies against the M proteins cross reacts with glycoproteins antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues because these glycoproteins share similar features with M antigenic domain.",Pediatrics,

Low-energy photons that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path. 
A filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.

What could be the probable diagnosis –,VSD large,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Ebstein anomaly,AP window defect,1,single,"livpolastic left heart syndrome 

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).
Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:

(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body
Entrace and exit of the ventricle
Mitral and aortic valves

This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.
In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.
The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic

arteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two
of these connections:
(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)
Ductus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)

Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.
In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.
Babies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.
Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).

Symptoms

At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:


Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color
Cold hands and feed (extremities)


Lethargy


Poor pulse
Poor suckling and feeding
Pounding heart
Rapid breathing
Shortness of breath.
Since the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.
Signs of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.

Ventricular septal defect

These patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.
They usually present with congestive cardiac failure.

Ebstein's anomaly 

Ebstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.
These patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.
They may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.

Aorticopulmonary window defect

An Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.
In these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy.",Pediatrics,

These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The ﬁrst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (‘polychromasia’). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.
Proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.

Management of DIC

The most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section
Volume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.
500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000–15,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.
To replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.
Cryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand’s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.
In case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20–30,000/ml – platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml
Recombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 μg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.
Role of Heparin

According to Williams Obs. “Heparin is not used in DIC.”
According to COGDT 10/e, p 999
“Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.”
As far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says –
“EACA is not recommended in case of DIC.”
According to Williams Obs 23/e, p 787
“It use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended”",Gynaecology & Obstetrics,

Reflux is more common in females and it is usually detected earlier in females so we can say that reflux is present from birth but it is usually detected at 2-3 years of age but in feinales the age of detection is earlier.

Features are -

In primary reflux the patient usually presents with symptoms of pyelonephritis or cystitis.
In secondary reflux manifestation of primary diseases are usually the presenting symptoms
Reflux is the most common cause of pyelonephritis. It is seen in 30-50% of patients with pyelonephritis.

The other useful technique for detecting vesicoureteric reflux is radionuclide imaging.

If the avulsion occurred in a clean environment, nothing should be done to the tooth before replants it. If the tooth is dirty, an attempt should be made to clean the root surface, but it is very important to preserve any remnants of the periodontal ligament that are still attached to the root. 'therefore the parent would then be instructed to keep the tooth immersed in a suitable storage medium and bring the child and the tooth for immediate care.
The patient should receive immediate attention after arriving at the dental office; and if it seems any contamination than it should be rinse thoroughly with saline only do not attempt to scrub tooth by any means to prevent vitality of periodontal fibers and re-implant it in socket.

Allowing the avulsed tooth to dehydrate before replantation is damaging to a favourable prognosis.
Hanks buffered saline, isotonic saline, and pasteurized bovine milk may be the most favourable known storage media. If none of these solutions is readily available, human saliva is acceptable short-term substitute storage liquid. Presumably, the patient's saliva (and perhaps blood) would be readily available.
Although tap water has been a commonly recommended storage solution (and its use would be preferable to allowing dehydration of the tooth), saliva is a better storage medium. Neither water nor saliva is as good as milk or saline, if the tooth must be stored for a long period (more than 30 minutes before replantation).

Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization.

R. M. Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose–chin line as a reference point. These values are for Caucasians and clearly cannot be applied to all races.

Maternal infection: The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.
Clinical course (HBV): Nearly 90–95% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Diagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107–1011).
Screening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for ‘high risk’ groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).
Hepatitis C (HCV):
It is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.
Perinatal transmission (10–40%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.
Detection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.
Confirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).
Chronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.
Hepatitis D (HDV):
It is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.

The auriculotemporal syndrome is an unusual phenomenon, which arises as a result of damage to the auriculotemporal nerve and subsequent reinnervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic salivary fibres.
Clinical Features 
The patient typically exhibits flushing and sweating of the involved side of the face, chiefly in the temporal area, during eating. The severity of this sweating may often be increased by tart foods. Of further interest is the fact that profuse sweating may be evoked by the parenteral administration of pilocarpine or eliminated by the administration of atropine or by a procaine block of the auriculotemporal nerve.
There is a form of gustatory sweating which occurs in otherwise normal individuals when they are eating certain foods, particularly spicy or sour ones. This consists of diffuse facial sweating, not simply a perioral sweating and may even be on a hereditary basis.

A UTI may be suspected based on the symptoms or finding on urinalysis or both, but a urine culture is necessary for confirmation and appropriate therapy.
Thus the diagnosis of UTI depends on having the proper sample of urine.
There are several ways to obtain a urine sample, some are more accurate than others.
These methods are —


Midstream urine sample —

It is satisfactory in toilet trained children and in circumcised boys. But in young infants and boys who cannot ratract their foreskin, it is not reliable. Such samples will usually reflect periurethral and prepucial organisms and cells.

Collection in an adhesive sealed sterile collection bag after disinfection of the genitals


Is a useful technique in infants, but potential contamination from genitals and perianal area can occur.

3. Urine specimen through catheterization or indwelling catheter —

Urine specimen through a catheter is less likely to be contaminated than the voided specimens as described above. It is also less invasive than suprapubic aspiration, but it is not as sensitive as suprapubic aspiration.


A catherized specimen is reliable if the first portion of the urine that may contain urethral organisms is discarded and specimen is taken from later flow through the catheter, but it has the disadvantage of being traumatic and of potentially introducing urethral organisms into sterile bladder


Suprapubic aspiration -
Suprapubic aspiration is best method to collect urine specimen for culture.
It is the most reliable method
It can be performed safely in children and in premature infants by 21 or 22 gauge needle.
This procedure avoids any sort of contamination, however it is invasive. So it is used only in infants and selected patients.
Note:

The sensitivity of suprapubic aspiration is 99 %

The sensitivity of catherization is 95%",Pediatrics,

The primers hybridize with their complementary single-stranded DNA produced in the first step.Step 3: Polymerization: New DNA strands are synthesized by Taq polymerase. This enzyme is derived from bacteria Thermus aquaticus that are found in hot springs.The steps of 1,2 and 3 are repeated. In each cycle, the DNA strands are doubled. Thus, 20 cycles provide for 1 million times amplifications. These cycles are generally repeated by automated instrument, called Tempcycler.5.

The additive eﬀect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force can exceed the tensile strength of the porcelain and causes crack propagation in the porcelain veneer. When the contraction coeﬃcient of the porcelain is much lower than that of the metal (αP much lower than αM), porcelain cracking or metal-ceramic bond failure can occur near the metal-porcelain interface. This incompatibility failure is likely caused by the development of radial tensile stresses that exceed the tensile strength of porcelain.

Valproate increases chances of birth defects much more than phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbitone and hence if valproate is being used, it should be substituted by a lesser teratogenic drug.
Now in this question:
A 26-year-old primigravida with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who has been using valproic acid comes to you at fourth month of pregnancy for advice.
Logically speaking if patient has myoclonic epilepsy in non pregnant states-DOC is valproic acid —Harrsion 18/e, p 3266 or lamotrigine, so her physician must have prescribed valproic acid to her. Ideally valproic acid should not be used during pregnancy as it is associated with a high risk of congenital malformations in the fetus. So if this patient would have come in the first trimester, I would have substituted it with some other antiepileptic drug like lamotrigine.",Gynaecology & Obstetrics,

As calculus is removed, resistance to  the  passage  of  the  cutting  edge  diminishes  until  only  a  slight roughness  remains. Longer, lighter  root-planing  strokes  are  then activated with less lateral pressure until the root surface is completely smooth and hard. The instrument handle must be rolled carefully between the thumb and fingers to keep the blade adapted closely to the tooth surface as line angles, developmental depressions, and other changes in tooth contour are followed. Scaling and root-planing strokes should be confined to the portion of the tooth where calculus or altered cementum is found; this area is known as the instrumentation zone. Sweeping the instrument over the crown where it is not needed wastes operating time, dulls the instrument, and causes loss  of control.
Key Concept:
Scaling and root-planing strokes should be confined to the portion of the tooth where calculus or altered cementum is found; this area is known as the instrumentation zone. Sweeping the instrument over the crown where it is not needed wastes operating time, dulls the instrument, and causes loss  of control.

Mucosal advancement (Submucous) V’plasty:

The mucous membrane of the vestibule is undermined and advanced to line both sides of the extended vestibule.


Secondary epithelization vestibuloplasty:

The mucosa of the vestibule is used to line one side of the extended vestibule, and the other side heals by growing a new epithelial surface.

PPV depends on sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of disease in the population.
Now in this question, a screening test is used in same way in two similar populations; thereby the screening test will have similar sensitivity and specificity in both populations.
PPV = a/ (a + (b) X 100, thus b (False Positive rate) is inversely proportional to PPV; and PPV is directly proportional to Prevalence of disease in a population.
So, False Positive rate (FP rate) is inversely proportional to the prevalence of disease in the population.
Therefore, if the same screening test is having lower FP rate in population A (as compared to a similar population B), then this could be explained by higher prevalence of disease in population A

Incomplete rupture is commonly referred to as scar dehiscence.
Scar dehiscence is an intraoperative finding always. The greatest risk factor for either complete or incomplete uterine rupture is prior cesarean delivery.
Following uterine rupture the most common electronic fetal monitoring finding is sudden, severe heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations, bradycardia, and undetectable fetal heart action.
In some cases in which the fetal presenting part has entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the site of uterine rupture, abdominal palpitation or vaginal examination may be helpful to identify the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet.
A firm contracted uterus may at times be felt alongside the fetus. With rupture and expulsion of the fetus into the peritoneal cavity, the chances for intact fetal survival are dismal, and reported morality rates range from 50% to 75%.

Management of shoulder dystocia:
Shoulder dystocia should be managed as quickly as possible as interval of time from delivery of head to delivery of body is of great importance as far as survival of baby is concerned. Management follows a sequence of steps together called as Shoulder Dystocia Drill.
First line measures:

Immediately after recognition of shoulder dystocia extra help should be called, in the form of midwifery assistance, an obstetrician, a paediatric resuscitation team and an anaesthetist.
Maternal pushing should be discouraged, as this may lead to further impaction of the shoulder, thereby exacerbating the situation.
Liberal episiotomy should be given to provide more space posteriorly.
Fundal pressure should not be employed. As it is associated with an unacceptably high neonatal complication rate and may result in uterine rupture.
Moderate suprapubic pressure can be applied by the assistant.

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder characterized by the intraalveolar accumulation of pulmonary surfactant.
Two clinically distinct forms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are seen -


Fatal form                                -->          Presenting shortly after birth (congenital PAP)

u Gradually progressive form -->           Presenting in older infants and children
Pathology

Although the mechanisms that lead to alveolar proteinosis are undefined, histological findings suggests that they result in a disruption of pulmonary surfactant metabolism.
The main surface tension lowering agent in surfactant is phospholipids le. primary dipalmitol phosphatidyl choline.
However DPCC needs surfactant protein (in endogenous and natural surfactants) for efficient dispersion which enables the formation of a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
There are two surfactant proteins present in the body i.e., protein A and protein B.
In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, there is absence of protein B.
In the absence of protein B, the rapid spread and absorption of the phospholipid (DPCC) does not take place so they cannot form a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
This in turn leads to failure of expansion of alveoli leading to poor cardiorespiratory adaptation at birth.

Clinical manifestation -

This disorder is immediately apparent in the newborn period and rapidly leads to respiratory failure.
Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from more common disorders of the newborn that lead to respiratory failure including pneumonia, generalized bacterial infection, respiratory distress syndrome and total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction.

Diagnosis

Histopathological examination of lung biopsy specimen is the gold standard for diagnosis.
On histopathological examination distal air spaces are filled with a granular, eosinophillic material that stains

positively with periodic - acid schiff reagent and is diastase resistant.
Treatment

Untreated, alveolar proteinosis in newborns is rapidly fatal and no successful medical therapy has been developed.
Repeated bronchoalveolar lavage is a temporizing measure.
Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option but its use is limited by concerns about disease recurrence.",Pediatrics,

Leucodystrophy refers to progressive degeneration of the white matter of the brain clue to imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibre.
Myelin which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of at least ten different chemicals.
The leucodystrophy are a group of disorders that are caused by genetic defects in hoW myelin produces or metabolizes these chemicals.
Each of the leucodystrophies in the result of a defect in the gene that controls one (and only one) of the chemicals. Specific leusodystrophies include -

Extra-low and putty forms are available only for condensation and addition silicones.
Polysulfide is provided only in light-body and heavy-body consistencies. There is no heavy-body product for condensation silicone. Pigments are added to give each material a distinct color.
The base paste, is a polysulfide polymer that contains a multifunctional mercaptan (-SH) called a polysulfide polymer, a suitable  filler  (such as lithopone or titanium dioxide) to provide the required strength, a plasticizer (such as dibutyl phthalate) to confer the appropriate viscosity to the paste, and a small quantity of sulfur, approximately 0.5%, as an accelerator.

The four zones 

Zone of infection
Zone of contamination

Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.
This new bone was built in an irregular fashion.",Dental,

WHat is your diagnosis?,Labyrinthitis,BPPV,Vestibular neuronitis,Meniere's disease,1,single,"Positional veigo/ BPPV: It is characterized by veigo when the head is placed in a ceain critical position. There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated. A bone vibrator placed on the mastoid bone helps to loosen the debris. - Meniere's disease: Has an episodic veigo and it lasts for >20 minutes. - Vestibular neuronitis: Veigo lasts for many days. - Labyrinthitis: There is a history of fever and trauma, and the veigo lasts for days.",ENT,AIIMS 2018

This addition is appropriate when the casting alloy is gold, but there is disagreement regarding the effects of carbon in phosphate investments used for casting silver-palladium alloys, palladium-silver alloys, or base metal alloys. It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 °C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.

The α-hemihydrate form of gypsum is generally the binder for investments used in casting gold-containing alloys with melting ranges below 1000 °C. When this material is heated at temperatures sufficiently high to completely dehydrate the investment and to ensure complete castings, it shrinks considerably and occasionally fractures.
A mixture of silica and calcinated gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO4• 1/2 H2O) results in setting expansion greater than that of the gypsum product used alone. The silica particles probably interfere with the intermeshing and interlocking of the crystals as they form. Thus, the thrust of the crystals is outward during growth, and they increase expansion.

Initially shunt is from left to right as the systemic vascular pressure is greater than pulmonary vascular pressure. With time pulmonary vascular resistance increases due to change in pulmonary vessel wall as a result of increased flow in pulmonary vessels. When pulmonary vascular pressure exceeds the systemic vascular resistance, reversal of shunt into right to left shunt occurs.
This development of right to left shunt due to reversal of left to right shunt as a result of development of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension is called Eisenmenger syndrome.",Pediatrics,
