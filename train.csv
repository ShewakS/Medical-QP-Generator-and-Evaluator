Hemophilia A is due to deficiency offactor VIII.
Hemophilia 'A' is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait.
Factor VIII is an intrinsic pathway component required for activation of factor X.
Clinical manifestations are due to defect in coagulation system -


Large post-traumatic ecchymoses or hematoma
Prolonged bleeding after a laceration or any form of surgical procedure.
Bleeding into weight bearing joints.



Petechiae are characteristically absent (in contrast to platelet dysfunction where bleeding occurs from small vessels of the skin and mucous membrane, e.g. petechiae).

Small bowel -3cm
Cecum - 9cm
Distal large bowel -6cm (some books write 5cm)
Air-fluid levels in case of obstruction are seen on 'erect' abdominal films and not on 'supine', hence their absence on supine x rays would not rule out presence of obstruction.
About option 'c' 
Its very strange to combine 2 different pathologies in one generalization. Moreover volvulus can be of many types: gastric, midgut, cecal and sigmoid.
Whereas gastric, cecal and sigmoid volvulus can have specific plain x ray appearance, the midgut volvulus picture is usually non specific.
In mesenteric ischemia plain abdominal x-rays are relatively nonspecific and may be completely normal in more than it 25 percent of patients. Findings suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia include the presence of an ileus with distended loops of bowel, bowel wall thickening (particularly prominent in acute mesenteric venous thrombosis), and/or pneumatosis intestinalis. Multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography can be used to diagnose mesenteric ischemia in stable patients.",Surgery,

Frequent episodes of lymphangitis and cellulitis may occur. this is believed to be due to loss of local immune defence mechanism. Chronic eczema, a fungal infection of the skin (dermatophytosis) and nails (onychomycosis), fissuring, verrucae and papillae (was) are frequently seen in advanced disease. Rarely malignancy (lymphangiosarcoma or angiosarcoma) may occur in chronic lymphoedema.

Baby friendly hospital initiatives

Baby friendly hospital initiative (BFHI) was launched for promotion, protection and support of breastfeeding.
It was launched by WHO and UNICEF.
BFHI has listed following ten steps, which the hospital must fulfill.


Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all health care staff
Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement this policy.
Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding.
Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within a half-hour of birth.
Show mothers how to breastfeed, and how to maintain lactation even if they should be separated from their infants.
Give newborn infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated.
Practice rooming-in-allow mothers and infants to remain together - 24 hours a day.
Encourage breastfeeding on demand.
Give no artificial teats or pacifiers (also called dummies or soothers) to breastfeeding infants.
Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic.",Social & Preventive Medicine,

Tissues that do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake include brain, erythrocytes (RBC), the epithelial cells of kidney & intestine, Liver, and Cornea & lens of eye.The mechanism through which insulin increases glucose uptake is different in different tissues. In the muscle and adipose tissues, insulin increase facilitated diffusion by increasing glucose transpoer (GLUT4) on the cell membrane.In the liver, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes indirectly by induction of glucokinase so that the glucose entering the liver cells is promptly conveed to glucose - 6 - phosphate (glucose trapping). This keeps the intracellular glucose concentration low and ours entry of glucose into the liver. Thus, though the liver do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes. That means glucose entery can occur in liver without the action of insulin, but this is facilitated by insulin. On the other hand, myocytes (skeletal and cardiac muslces) and adipocytes (adipose tissue) are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake.",Physiology,

It is closed above by the septum crurale.# Right side is affected twice as often as the left# rare before puberty# female to male ratio is about 2:1# female patients are frequently elderly, the male patients are usually between 30 and 40 years of age.# A fully distended femoral hernia assumes the shape of a retort and its bulbous extremity may be above the inguinal ligament.# Laugier's femoral hernia. This is a hernia through a gap in the lacunar (Gimbernat's) ligament. The diagnosis is based on unusual medial position of a small femoral hernia sac. The hernia has nearly always strangulated.# Narath's femoral hernia. This occurs only in patients with congenital dislocation of the hip and is due to lateral displacement of the psoas muscle. The hernia lies hidden behind the femoral vessels.# Cloquet's hernia. Cloquet's hernia is one in which the sac lies under the fascia covering the pectineus muscle. Strangulation is likely. The sac may coexist with the usual type of femoral hernia sac.# RX:The constant risk of strangulation is sufficient reason to recommend operation, which should be carried out soon after the diagnosis has been made. A truss is contraindicated because of this risk.# Operative treatment.Several approaches to the femoral hernia have been advocated including the low operation (Lockwood), the high operation (McEvedy) and the inguinal operation (Lotheissen). In all cases the bladder must be emptied by catheterisation immediately before commencing surgery.Morgagni hernia# Commonly occurs through Right anterior diaphragm.# Usually contains omentum and transverse colon.Bochdalek hernia# Congenital diaphragmatic hernia# Occurs through posterior pleuroperitoneal canal/ defect.# 80% occur on left side.# Best predictor of prognosis is Pulmonary hypertensionExomphalos (syn. omphalocele)# Herniation or protrusion of the abdominal contents into the base of the umbilical cord.# In contrast to the more common umbilical hernia, the sac is covered with peritoneum without overlying skin.# Associated with chromosomal abnormalities (50%) and severe malformations like cardiac anomalies (50%), and neural tube defects (40%), hence mortality rate is high in omphalocele.Gastroschisis# Paramedian full-thickness abdominal fusion defect usually on right side of umbilical cord; may involve thorax; bowel is nonrotated and lacks secondary fixation to dorsal abdominal wall.Umblical hernia# Repaired After 1 year of age, if required.Spigelian hernia repair# Interparietal hernia occurring at the level of the arcuate line.# The patient is often corpulent and usually over 50 years of age, men and women being equally affected.# Retraction of External oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis muscles laterally is done during its surgical repair.Indirect inguinal hernia# It is congenital in origin.# It is more common than a direct inguinal hernia.# It is much more common in males than in females.# It is more common on the right side.# It is most common# An indirect inguinal hernial sac travels down the canal on anterolateral aspect of spermatic cord. # The neck of the sac is narrow.# The hernial sac may extend through the superficial inguinal ring above and medial to the pubic tubercle. (Femoral hernia is located below and lateral to the pubic tubercle)# The hernial sac may extend down into the scrotum or labium majus.Direct inguinal hernia# Occurs through Hasselbach's triangle (Deep Inguinal Ring) as a result of weakness of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal.# An inguinal hernia can be differentiated from femoral by sac neck relation to medial end of inguinal ligament and pubic tubercle, i.e., in inguinal hernia neck is above and medial while in femoral it is below and lateral to medial end of inguinal ligament and pubic tubercle.# So, direct hernia -sac is posterior, Indirect hernia -sac anterolateral.# Direct hernias do not often attain a large size or descend into scrotum.# In contrast to an indirect inguinal hernia, a direct inguinal hernia lies behind the spermatic cord.# As neck of the sac is wide, direct hernias do not often strangulate.# A direct inguinal hernia is always acquired (Smoking, occupation that involves straining & heavy lifting & damage to ilioinguinal nerve)# Women practically never develop a direct inguinal hernia (It is common in old men with weak abdominal muscles and is rare in women).Hiatus hernia# Most common complication esophagitis.# Best diagnosed by Ba meal.# Rx: Heller's operation# Paraoesophageal ('rolling') hiatus hernia are dangerous.Paraduodenal HerniaAthletic pubalgiaParastomal hernia# Congenital defect in descending mesocolon.# Sports Hernia; Gilmore's Groin/Groin Disruption.# Most commonly seen with End Colostomy.",Surgery,Hernia

Health education is the act of getting people to do something for themselves to attain better health. Health education involves teaching about reducing health risk factors, increasing a person' s level of wellness and taking specific protective health measures. There are 4 well-known approaches to health education: 1. Regulatory approach (Managed prevention) - There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations. - The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behaviour through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behaviour and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E.g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat belts 2. Service approach - The service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation. * - This is mainly the responsibility of the health depament and health workers both in government and non? government health agencies. - The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health. - The service approach will be a failure when it is not based an the ""felt needs"" of the people. 3. Health education approach - The health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health. - Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E.g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, feility control. 4. Primary health care approach - The primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health. - This is a radically new approach staing from the people with their full paicipation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination. - The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health. Mass media is a method of health communication. (p766, 768, Park 20/e)",Social & Preventive Medicine,

Rarely, trigeminal neuralgia can cause otalgia. Oral cavity carcinoma can also cause referred ear pain this pathway. Via Facial nerve . This can come from the teeth (most commonly the upper molars, when it will be worse when drinking cold fluids), the temporomandibular joint (due to its close relation to the ear canal), or the parotid gland. Via Glossopharyngeal nerve . This comes from the oropharynx, and can be due to pharyngitis or tonsillitis, or to carcinoma of the oropharynx (base of tongue, soft palate, pharyngeal wall, tonsils). Via Vagus nerve . This can arise from the laryngopharynx in carcinoma of this area, or from the esophagus in GERD. Via the second and third spinal segments, C2 and C3.

Symptoms often occur after reading, computer work, or other close activities that involve tedious visual tasks.When concentrating on a visually intense task, such as continuously focusing on a book or computer monitor, the ciliary muscletightens. This can cause the eyes to get irritated and uncomfortable. Giving the eyes a chance to focus on a distant object at least once an hour usually alleviates the problem.Sometimes, asthenopia can be due to specific visual problems, for example, uncorrected refraction errors or binocular vision problems such as accommodative insufficiency orheterophoria. It is often caused by the viewing of monitors such as those of computers or phones.ESOPHORIAEXOPHORIA* Common in younger group*** Increased accommodation* Excessive use of convergence may cause esophoria(as occurs in bilateral congenital myopes )* Dissociation factor such as prolonged constant use of one eye may result in exophoria (as occurs in individuals using uniocular microscope and watch makers using uniocular magnifying glass)* Elderly* Decreased accommodation* Decreased use of convergence is often associated with exophoria (as seen in presbyopes)Symptoms1.

Chemical modifiers have been used extensively to increase or decrease the setting time of gypsum products; they are called retarders and accelerators, respectively. The manufacturers use both types of compounds to formulate gypsum products with specific setting times.
The chemical that increases the rate of hemihydrate dissolution or precipitation of dihydrate accelerates the setting reaction. The most commonly used accelerator is potassium sulfate, which is particularly effective in concentrations greater than 2%. Slurry water flowing out from a model trimmer contains numerous fine gypsum particles that act as nuclei of crystallization and that can serve as an effective accelerator.
Key Concept: 
Chemical modifiers have been used extensively to increase or decrease the setting time of gypsum products; they are called retarders and accelerators, respectively.

The enlargement of the aerial channels presses on the veins situated in these structures preventing outflow of blood through them. The collection of blood in the distensile channels due to aerial dilatation leads to penile erection. Erection is mediated by parasympathetic nerves (S2, S3, S4) and non adrenergic and noncholinergic pathways which induces release of NO from endothelium in penile vasculature. NO induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation allowing enhancement of blood flow leading to erection. The primary drugs used in erectile dysfunction e.g. Slidenafil, Tadalafil and Vardenfil act on Nitric oxide pathway to improve erectile dysfunction. Nitric oxide mediates its action by increasing cGMP concentration. cGMP is finally degraded by an enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). Slidenafil and other oral agents are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE-5). These enzymes inhibits PDE-5 and thus they reduce the degradation of cGMP. Increased cGMP facilitates the relaxation of distensile channels of penis. Besides phosphodiesterase inhibitors several other drugs are also used these days - Prostaglandin Ei. E2 - Alprostadil - Transurethral alprostadil - Injectable phentolamine - Apomorphine (used in Europe only) PQK - Intracavernous injection PGE1 is widely used for treating erectile dysfunction. - PGE2 (intrauretbrall) can also be used to increase penile blood flow and treat erectile dysfunction.

An obsession has following characteristic : - An idea, impulse or image which intrudes into the conscious awareness repeatedly. It is recognized as one's own ideas, impulse or image but is perceived as egoalien (foreign to one's personality). It is recognized as irrational and absurd (insight is present --4 Patient knows about disorder). Patient tries to resist against it but is unable to do so which leads to marked distress or anxiety. A compulsion has following characteristics :- It is repetitive, purposeful form of behavior is carried out because of strong feeling of compulsion to do so. It usually follows an obsession. ts goal is to prevent or reduce the anxiety or stress caused by obsession however it do not always succeed in doing so. It is irrational or excessive and not realistic. Insight is present. A patient with OCD may have an obsession, a compulsion or both (mostly patients have both). A patient with OCD realizes the irrationality of the obsession and experiences both the obsession and the compulsion as ego-dystonic (unwanted behavior).

An S3 heart sound occurs during the rapid-filling phase of the ventricle in early diastole. In mitral valve incompetence and increased preload in the left ventri­cle, an S3 heart sound is an excellent indicator of ventricular failure. The increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure is reflected back into the left atrium, with a subsequent increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins. When pulmonary venous pressure is greater than the pulmonary capillary on­co tic pressure, a transudate leaks first into the intersti­tium (Kerley lines on a chest radiograph) and eventu­ally into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and congestion.
Dyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfort­able breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided heart failure. When a patient with left-sided heart failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the heart. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxys­mal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths.
Another finding associated with left-sided heart fail­ure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective arterial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The disproportionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia.",Unknown,

C: AntipsychoticsNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) refers to the combination of hypehermia, rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation that can occur as a serious complication of the use of antipsychotic drugs.The list of atypical antipsychotic drugs that may cause NMS include olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and quetiapine.Clozapine may also be associated with the development of NMS, but it appears to be less likely to manifest with extrapyramidal features, including rigidity and tremor.The most widely accepted mechanism by which antipsychotics cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome is that of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism.Central D2 receptor blockade in the hypothalamus, nigrostriatal pathways, and spinal cord leads to increased muscle rigidity and tremor extrapyramidal pathways. Hypothalamic D2 receptor blockade results in an elevated temperature set point and impairment of heat-dissipating mechanisms.Peripherally, antipsychotics lead to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contractility, which can contribute to hypehermia, rigidity, and muscle cell breakdown.",Psychiatry,

Genetically determined diseases that are multifactorial in origin (ie, neural tube defects) do not conform to the Mendelian pattern of inheritance but exhibit a variable outcome that reflects the interaction between a particular genotype and an environment. The relatives of persons with diseases of multifactorial origin have an increased risk of having similar abnormalities.The recurrence risk for most single primary defects of multifactorial inheritance (eg, neural tube defects) is increased with each child affected. This increased risk forms the basis for assuming that genetic factors play a role in the occurrence of these abnormalities. Other factors, such as race, sex, and ethnic and racial background, influence the frequency with which an abnormality of multifactorial inheritance occurs in relatives The prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects (anencephaly and meningomyelocele) can be made by the detection of elevated levels of alpha- fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid. To reduce the risk of neural tube defects, it is now recommended that all women capable of becoming pregnant take between 400 mcg and 800 mcg of folic acid daily.",Pediatrics,New Born Infants

This variation results paly from a capability of the brain itself to suppress input of pain signals to thenervous system by activating a pain control system called an analgesia system. The analgesia system consists of three major components: (1) The periaqueductal gray and periventricular areas of the mesencephalon and upper pons surround the aqueduct of Sylvius and poions of the third and fouh ventricles. Neurons from these areas send signals to (2) the raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus located in the lower pons and upper medulla, and the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla. From these nuclei, second-order signals are transmitted down the dorsolateral columns in the spinal cord to (3) a pain inhibitory complex located in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. At this point, the analgesia signals can block the pain before it is relayed to the brain.

Robbin's pathology 7th/ 18-D; Ananthanarayan Microbiology, 7th/ 552)HBV is a partially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus packaged with a core protein (HBcAg) and DNA polymerase, and enclosed by envelope proteins (HBsAg). Following receptor-mediated entry into hepatocytes, the virus enters the nucleus, where its DNA is frequently integrated into the host genome.The HBV has four genes: S, P, C, and X. The S gene codes for the ""major"" envelope protein (HBsAg). The largest is P gene. It codes for DNA polymerase. The C gene codes for HBeAg and HBcAg. The C gene has a precore and a core region. If translation is initiated at the precore region, the protein product is HBeAg. If translation begins with the core region, HBcAg is the protein product. HBeAg is a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. The precore region is not necessary for viral replication. Precore mutants can replicate. They are readily detectable by HBV DNA in serum, but hepatitis B e antigen (HbeAg) is absent. The X gene codes for HBxAg. The product of the X gene is hepatitis B x antigen (HBxAg). It may be involved in carcinogenesis. Basal core promoter mutants cause a reduction in HBeAg production.Protein synthesis proceeds from 4 open reading frames:# Envelope proteins - Major, Middle, and Large - (HBsAg) from the -S gene, pre-Sl, and pre-S2 gene sequences;# The e antigen (HBeAg) and core protein (HBcAg) from the -C gene and pre-C gene sequence;# DNA polymerase protein from the -P gene; and# Transactivator X-protein from the -X gene.",Microbiology,Virology

Cancer of paranasal sinus constitutes 3% of all carcinomas of the aerodigestive tract. The majority of paranasal sinus malignancies (50-80%) originate within the maxillary sinus antrum. Malignancies rarely occur within the other sinuses and originate in the ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses in 10%, 1% and 1% respectively. The cause of parasinus malignancy is unknown. However several risk factors have been associated and therefore it is seen more commonly in people working in hardwood furniture industry, nickel refining, leather work, and manufacturer of mustard gas. More than 80% of the malignant tumours are of squamous cell variety. Rest are adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, melanoma, and various type of sarcomas. Workers of furniture industry develop adenocarcinoma of the Ethmoids and upper nasal cavity. While those engaged in Nickel refining get squamous cell and Anaplastic carcinoma. Clinical features for maxillary carcinoma It is seen more commonly in the 7th decade of life. Males are affected more commonly than females. Early features of maxillary sinus malignancy are nasal stuffiness, blood-stained nasal discharge, facial paraesthesias or pain and epiphora. These symptoms may be missed or simply treated as sinusitis. Late features will depend on the direction of spread and extent of growth. Medial spread to nasal cavity gives rise to nasal obstruction, discharge and epistaxis. It may also spread into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses and that is why most antral malignancies are antroethmoidal in nature. Anterior spread causes swelling of cheeks. Inferior spread leads to expansion of alveolus with dental pain, loosening of teeth, poor fitting dentures, ulceration of gingiva. Superior spread invades the orbit causing proptosis, diplopia, ocular pain and epiphora. Posterior spread is into pterygomaxillary fossa, pterygoid plate and the pterygoid muscles causing trismus. Lymphatic spread in maxillary carcinoma is rare and occurs only in the late stages. Most commonly involved lymph node is submandibular lymph node followed by jugular nodes. Treatment of maxillary carcinoma For squamous cell carcinoma, the treatment of choice is a combination of radiotherapy and surgery. Radiotherapy can be given before or after surgery. Very often, a full course of pre-operative telecobalt therapy is given, followed 4 - 6 weeks later by surgical excision of the growth by total or extended maxillectomy.",ENT,

There are winter epidemics in developed countries, paicularly in nurseries. Adults in close contact with cases may develop disease. The incubation period is 48 hours and patients present with watery diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. Dehydration is prominent. Diagnosis is aided by commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits, which require fresh or refrigerated stool samples. Immunity develops to natural infection. Monovalent and multivalent vaccines have been licensed in many countries and have now demonstrated efficacy in large trials in Africa and the Americas. The early diagnosis of human rotavirus infection is essential for effective patient management and infection control. We repo here a rapid, easy-to-perform, and inexpensive test for rotavirus detection. The viral RNA is extracted directly from the stools and electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels. Currently available immunoassays for routine diagnostic purposes are directed at the common group A-specific antigen. As repos become available on human gastroenteritis caused by the atypical or novel rotaviruses, this technique presents an added advantage in that it can detect both group A and non-group A rotaviruses.

On people with darker skin the patches may be purple in color. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage.Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon. Goeckerman therapy is a regimen for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis using a combination of crude coal tar and aificial ultraviolet radiation. It is a specialized form of light therapy. *First formulated in 1925 by American dermatologist William H. Goeckerman (1884-1954), Goeckerman therapy continues to be used due to its efficacy and safety profile.Individual institutions have modified the Goeckerman regimen and developed their own protocols. Standard therapy includes use of 2-4% crude coal tar in a petroleum base applied daily to the psoriatic plaques. The minimum period of time for tar application is 2-hours, although it has been recognized that greater periods of time produce better results. The patient is then exposed to broad-band ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, although narrow-band UVB may also be used.Laboratory studies have shown that the combination of coal tar and UV light reduces epidermal DNA synthesis. 1953, John Ingram, an English dermatologist, added topical anthralin paste to his Goeckerman regimen.

B: Cyclical Influenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is an infectious disease caused by RNA viruses of the family Ohomyxoviridae (the influenza viruses), that affects birds and mammals. These viruses are only distantly related to the human parainfluenza viruses, which are RNA viruses belonging to the paramyxovirus family that are a common cause of respiratory infections in children such as croup. Sore throat, fever and coughs are the most frequent symptoms. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, paicularly for the young and the elderly. Typically, influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by direct contact with bird droppings or nasal secretions, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight, disinfectants and detergents. As the virus can be inactivated by soap, frequent hand washing reduces the risk of infection. Influenza pandemics show cyclical trend and are known to occur at intervals of 740 years, due to antigenic variations.",Social & Preventive Medicine,

Unlike other chemotherapies, ATRA does not directly kill the malignant cells. ATRA induces the terminal differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, after which these differentiated malignant cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis on their own. ATRA alone is capable of inducing remission but it is sho-lived in the absence of concurrent ""traditional"" chemotherapy.As of 2013 the standard of treatment for concurrent chemotherapy has become arsenic trioxide, which combined with ATRA is referred to ATRA-ATO; before 2013 the standard of treatment was anthracycline (e.g. daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin or mitoxantrone)-based chemotherapy. Both chemotherapies result in a clinical remission in approximately 90% of patients with arsenic trioxide having a more orable side effect profile. ATRA therapy is associated with the unique side effect of retinoic acid syndrome. This is associated with the development of dyspnea, fever, weight gain, peripheral edema and is treated with dexamethasone. The etiology of retinoic acid syndrome has been attributed to capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating promyelocytes Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",Medicine,Haematology

Hazy cornea


Now we will discuss each of these :-
Amongst the given options meiotic pupil is seen only in acute anterior uveitis.
Normal anterior chamber with shallow anterior chamber in fellow eye may have any of the following :


The patient is predisposed to angle-closure glaucoma due to congenital bilateral shallow anterior chamber and this shallow anterior chamber is the normal depth of anterior chamber so, a normal appearing anterior chamber in the diseased eye is in fact deep due to any disease process.

or

Diseased eye has normal depth of anterior chamber. While the fellow eye has shallow anterior chamber and is predisposed to angle closure glaucoma.


So, the diseased eye has either normal depth or is deep (any of these can be seen in acute anterior uveitis).
Mildly elevated intraocular tension may be seen in acute anterior uveitis due to obstruction of the flow of aqueous from clogging of trabecular meshwork of anterior chamber. In an attack of acute angle closure glaucoma, IOP is usually markedly raised.
The hazy cornea may be seen both in angle closure glaucoma and acute anterior uveitis.

In this child, which one of the following would be expected to increase in RBC?",The life span of the RBCs,The rate of fatty acid oxidation,ATP production,"The levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate",3,single,"Function of Hb. Hb, found in the red blood cells, carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and returns carbon dioxide and protons from the tissues to the lungs.a. The oxygen saturation curve for Hb is sigmoidal (Figure I).(1). Each heme binds one O2 molecule, for a total of four O2 molecules per HbA molecule. HbA changes from the taut or tense (T) form to the relaxed (R) form when oxygen binds.(2). Binding of O2 to one heme group in Hb increases the affinity for O2 of its other heme groups. This effect produces the sigmoidal oxygen saturation curve and is known as positive cooperativity.b. The binding of protons to HbA stimulates the release of O2 , a manifestation of the Bohr effect (see Figure I).(1). Thus, O2 is readily released in the tissues where is high because of the production of CO2 by metabolic processes.(2). These reactions are reversed in the lungs. O2 binds to HbA, and CO2 is exhaled (see Figure II).c. Covalent binding of CO2 to HbA in the tissues also causes the release of O2 .d. Binding of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG), a side product of glycolysis in red blood cells, decreases the affinity of HbA for O2 . Consequently, O2 is more readily released in tissues when BPG is bound to HbA (see Figure I).e. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF), composed of two a subunits and two g subunits, has a lower affinity for BPG than does HbA, and therefore, HbF has a higher affinity for O2 than does HbA.The child has an inherited pyruvate kinase deficiency. This step converts phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, thereby producing ATP. A pyruvate kinase deficiency would slow down glycolysis, and less ATP would be produced. As PEP accumulates, so does 2-PG, 3-PG, and 1,3-BPG. The Luebering-Rapoport shunt converts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG (via bisphosphoglycerate mutase), which aids in releasing oxygen from hemoglobin in the tissues. The other intermediates of glycolysis before the blocked step would accumulate, and glucose-6-phosphate would inhibit hexokinase. Because of a lack of ATP, the life span of the cells would decrease. Fatty acids cannot serve as a source of energy because RBCs lack mitochondria, which is the site of fatty acid oxidation.I. Oxygen saturation curves for myoglobin and adult hemoglobin (HbA). Myoglobin has a hyperbolic saturation curve. HbA has a sigmoidal curve. The HbA curve shifts to the right at lower pH, with higher concentrations of BPG, or as CO2 binds to HbA in the tissues. Under these conditions, O2 is released more readily. P50 is the partial pressure of O2 at which half-saturation with O2 occurs. BPG, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.II. Effect of H+ on oxygen binding by hemoglobin (Hb). A. In the tissues, CO2 is released. In the red blood cells, this CO2 forms carbonic acid, which releases protons. The protons bind to Hb, causing it to release oxygen to the tissues. B. In the lungs, the reactions are reversed. O2 binds to protonated Hb, causing the release of protons. The protons bind to bicarbonate, forming carbonic acid, which is cleaved to water and CO2 , which is exhaled. RBC, red blood cell",Biochemistry,Carbohydrates

They also dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure to lessen the workload of your hea Angiotensin receptor blockers (losaan) Angiotensin receptor blockers are similar to ACE inhibitors, but they don't cause the cough that some people have when taking ACE inhibitors. Common side effects of angiotensin receptor blockers: Dizziness Changes in kidney function Combination medicines (Entresto, or sacubitril/valsaan) Entresto is a medicine that combines the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsaan with a substance known as sacubitril that causes the hea to squeeze harder and can help your body eliminate excess fluid. The effect of this combination can be more powerful than either drug alone. Entresto is usually staed after a person has been able to tolerate target doses of either an angiotension conveing enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), so this is not usually the first medicine used to treat hea failure. It is currently only used if other medicines have not improved the hea's ability to pump effectively. If you are taking an ACEI (such as lisinopril or enalapril) you will need to stop that medication for 36 hours before staing Entresto. This is very impoant; not doing so could result in a serious reaction. Digoxin (Lanoxin) This medicine slows hea rate and might improve the pumping ability of your hea. You'll get a blood test to make sure the dose you're taking is right for you. Hydralazine and nitrates (Apresoline, Nitrobid, Imdur, Isordil) Hydralazine and nitrates are often used together to treat hea failure. They dilate blood vessels so it's easier for your hea to receive and pump blood.

Don't mix microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with fragmentation syndrome. They are two separate entities, according to most standard text in hematology. Fragmentation syndrome Red cells when subjected to mechanical trauma may undergo .fragmentation in circulation. These fragment cells have shapes like triangular cells, helmet cells and are known as schistiocytes and are easily made out in a well made peripheral blood, film. Schistiocytes are the hallmark of diagnosis of this group of hemolytic anemia. Fragmentation of the red cell can occur either in large vessels or small vessels of capillaries and aerioles. Microangiopathic hemolytic Anemia When fragmentation occurs in small vessels of capillaries and aerioles due to the presence of thrombotic lesions, it is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is characterized by hemolytic anemia due to red cell .fragmentation. There is associated small vessel disease of capillaries and aerioles with thrombotic lesions. As the red cells pass through these microthrombi, red cells get attached to them and pa of RBC's get .fragmented by high shear forces.

APUD tumors are thought to have a common derivation from neural crest and neuroectoderm, thus the appellation, neuroendocrine tumors. However, there are some APUD tumors of endodermal origin. These tumors have dense core neurosecretory granules present on electron microscopy. Tumors involving these cells can be adenomas or carcinomas.

It is present in males at the bladder neck and proximal urethral. Its function is to prevent retrograde ejaculation of semen into the bladder during the time of ejaculation.In males the detrusor muscle fibers of the bladder at the region of bladder neck and proximal urethra are organized into internal urethral sphincter which is under involuntary control.In females the musculature surrounding the internal urethral orifice of the bladder is not organized into an internal sphincter.External urethral sphincter is present in both males and females.* Vaginal sphincter is formed by the fibres of pubococcygeus known as pubovaginalis.* There are other muscles also which contribute in compressing the vaginal orifice.* The Bulbospongiosus muscle fibres run anteriorly on either side of the vagina to attach to the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris and posteriorly to perineal body. Bulbospongiosus in females acts to constrict the vaginal orifice andexpress the secretions of greater vestibular glands. * The external urethral sphincter is composed of 3 muscles - sphincter urethrae, compressor urethrae, and urethrovaginal is sphincter (or muscle); last 2 muscles found in females only.* When external urethral sphincter contracts to compress the urethra, it compresses the vaginal orifice also.Muscles of the female perineum.",Anatomy,Female Genital System

C: HemorrhoidectomyExternal hemorrhoids develop around the rim of the anus. External hemorrhoids cause most of the symptoms associated with hemorrhoids (pain, burning, and itching) because the skin around them is very sensitive. If an external hemorrhoid becomes strangulated, a clot can form in it and become an excruciatingly painful thrombosed hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids develop inside the passageway of the anus. Internal hemorrhoids are often present without causing any discomfo or even awareness of their presence. Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, although they sometimes cause discomfo and bleeding if a hard stool rubs against them during a bowel movement. Internal hemorrhoids also may prolapse outside the anus, where they appear as small, grape-like masses. These can be painful.Internal hemorrhoids are classified by the degree of tissue prolapse into the anal canal:First-degree - hemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapseSecond-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse with straining or defecating and retract on their ownThird-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse and require manual reductionFouh-degree - hemorrhoids that chronically prolapse and, if reducible, fall out againManagement:Rubber band ligation - A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days.Sclerotherapy is one of the oldest forms of treatment. A chemical solution is injected directly into the hemorrhoid or the area around it. This solution causes a local reaction that interferes with blood flow inside the hemorrhoid, making the hemorrhoid shrink.Laser or electro-coagulation techniques - Both techniques use special devices to burn hemorrhoidal tissue.- Cryotherapy uses cold temperatures to obliterate the veins and cause inflammation and scarring. It is more time consuming, associated with more posttreatment pain, and is less effective than other treatments. Therefore, this procedure is not commonly used.- Hemorrhoidectomy - Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoid may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy. This is the best method for permanent removal of hemorrhoidHemorrhoidectomy is the treatment for:Severe third-degree and fouh-degree hemorrhoids.Second degree hemorrhoids that have not been cured with conservative measures.Fibrosed hemorrhoidsInterno-externo hemorrhoids when the external hemorrhoid is well defined.",Surgery,

It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. The water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse. This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant. In spherical structures like an alveolus, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 34. Introduction to Pulmonary Structure and Mechanics. In K.E. Barrett, S.M.

Free radicals o Free radicals are chemical species that have a single unpaired electron in the outer orbit. o Most of these are paially reduced reactive oxygen forms that are produced as an unavoidable byproduct of mitochondrial respiration --> also known as reactive oxygen species. o The most impoant are hydrogen peroxide (11202), Superoxide anion (02) and hydroxyl radical (OH). o Free radicals are highly reactive species and toxic --> they can damage the cell membrane and nucleic acids. o Free radicals initiate autocatalytic reactions, whereby molecules with which they react are themselves conveed into free radicals to propagate the chain of damage. o Free radicals are produced in several ways : ? I. Ionizing radiations (UV rays, X-rays) can hydrolyze water into hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) free radicals. Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals, e.g., CC14 can generate CC13. The reduction - oxidation reaction during normal metabolic process. During normal respiration, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced by addition of electron to generate water. In this process small amount of H202, 02- and OH- are produced. o H202 generated, can interact with 02 to generate OH through the Haber-weiss reaction. H202+ 02 --> OH- + OH + 02 Rapid burst of superoxide (02) occur in activated neutrophils during inflammation with the help ofNADPH oxidase. Some intracellular oxidases, e.g., xanthine oxidase generate superoxide radicals. Transition metal such as iron and copper donate or accept free electrons and catalyze free radical formation (see above fenton reaction).

6c6343a6-49d6-4335-b55e-d48d53009bed,Cellular and flagellar movement is carried out by all of the following except,Intermediate filaments,Actin,Tubulin,Myosin,0,multi,"Intermediate filament is 8 to 14 nm in diameter and is made up of various subunits. Some of these filaments connect the nuclear membrane to the cell membrane. They form a flexible scaffolding for the cell and help it resist external pressure. In their absence, cells rupture more easily, and when they are abnormal in humans, blistering of the skin is common. The proteins that make up intermediate filaments are cell type specific and are thus frequently used as cellular markers. For example, vimentin is a major intermediate filament in fibroblasts, whereas cytokeratin is expressed in epithelial cells. Microfilaments are long solid fibers with a 4 to 6 nm diameter that is made up of actin. Although actin is most often associated with muscle contraction, it is present in all types of cells. It is the most abundant protein in mammalian cells, sometimes accounting for as much as 15% of the total protein in the cell. Its structure is highly conserved; for example, 88% of the amino acid sequences in yeast and rabbit actin are identical. Actin filaments polymerize and depolymerize in vivo, and it is not uncommon to find polymerization occurring at one end of the filament while depolymerization is occurring at the other end. Filamentous (F) actin refers to intact microfilaments and globular (G) actin refers to the unpolymerized protein actin subunits. F-actin fibers attach to various pas of the cytoskeleton and can interact directly or indirectly with membrane-bound proteins. They reach to the tips of the microvilli on the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. They are also abundant in the lamellipodia that cells put out when they crawl along surfaces. The actin filaments interact with integrin receptors and form focal adhesion complexes, which serve as points of traction with the surface over which the cell pulls itself. In addition, some molecular motors use microfilaments as tracks. Microtubules are long, hollow structures with 5-nm walls surrounding a cavity 15 nm in diameter. They are made up of two globular protein subunits: a-and b-tubulin. A third subunit,g-tubulin, is associated with the production of microtubules by the centrosomes. The a and b subunits form heterodimers, which aggregate to form long tubes made up of stacked rings, with each ring usually containing 13 subunits. Because of their constant assembly and disassembly, microtubules are a dynamic poion of the cell skeleton. They provide the tracks along which several different molecular motors move transpo vesicles, organelles such as secretory granules, and mitochondria, from one pa of the cell to another. They also form the spindle, which moves the chromosomes in mitosis. Cargo can be transpoed in either direction on microtubules.

Halos are due to accumulation of fluid in the corneal epithelium and to alterations in the refractive condition of corneal lamellae. The colours are distributed as in normal spectrum, red on the outside, blue the innermost. Coicosteroid induced glaucoma generally occurs in white, painless eyes with an open normal looking angle, optic disc cupping, visual field defects, elevated IOP, & decreased outflow facility. Patients are usually asymptomatic but an acute presentation can occur if IOP is very high, when corneal oedema, blurred vision, ciliary hyperaemia, coloured halos and pain may occur. (but rare) Pigmentary glaucoma is a secondary open angle glaucoma due to pigment release is young male myopes who present with intermittent halos, an open angle, Krukenberg spindle of pigment (on corneal endothelium on slit lamp microscopy) and sampaolesi line on genioscopy (increased pigmentation in trabecular meshwork). Epidemic dropsy glaucoma (Bengal glaucoma) presents with diarrhoea, edema of legs, myocarditis. Coloured halos are marked & persistent. In Phakomorphic glaucoma the lens becomes intuinescentQ, either by rapid development of cataract or after traumatic rupture of its capsule. The swollen lens obliterates the angle by forcing root of iris against cornea. Phacolytic glaucoma is secondary open angle glaucoma that develops if the lens has been damaged or if lens proteins from a hypermature senile cataract escapes into aqueous. Phacotopic glaucoma develops in anterior subluxation or dislocations of lens especially if the iris becomes firmly contracted over the posterior surface of lens.",Ophthalmology,

B: Equilibrium From a functional point of view, the cerebellum is divided into three pas: The nodulus in the vermis and the flanking flocculus in the hemisphere on each side form the flocculonodular lobe, or vestibulocerebellum. This lobe, which is phylogenetically the oldest pa of the cerebellum, has vestibular connections and is concerned with equilibrium. The rest of the vermis and the adjacent medial poions of the hemispheres form the spinocerebellum, the region that receives proprioceptive input from the body as well as a copy of the ""motor plan"" from the motor coex. By comparing plan with performance, it smoothes and coordinates movements that are ongoing. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles, whereas the hemispheres project the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles. The lateral poions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebrocerebellum, or neocerebellum.

""Foreign body aspiration should always be considered as a potential cause of stridor and airway obstruction in children"".  --- O.P. Ghai
Foreign body aspiration

Infants and toddlers use their mouths to explore their surroundings.
So, they are very prone to aspirate a foreign body.
The most common age group is 6 months to 4 years.
Most common foreign body aspirated is nuts (peanuts).
Most airway foreign bodies lodge in a bronchus (right more than left).

Clinical manifestions
Three stages of symptoms may results : -


Stage I - Initial event → Violent paroxysm of coughing (a most common symptom), choking, gagging and wheeze immediately after aspiration. If the obstruction is complete, child may be unable to vocalize (aphonia) and there may be cyanosis. If the obstruction is incomplete drooling and stridor may occur.
Stage II Asymptomatic → The foreign body becomes lodged, reflex fatigue and immediate irritating symptoms subside. This stage is most treacherous and account for a large percentage of delayed diagnosis and overlooked foreign bodies.
Stage III - Complications → Obstruction, erosions or infection can cause fever, hemoptysis, pneumonia and atelectasis. The most serious complication of foreign body aspiration is complete airway obstruction.",Pediatrics,

These include:ReticulocytosisMarrow erythroid hyperplasiaHemosiderosisMild jaundice.Cholelithiasis (pigment stones - 40% to 50% cases)Moderate splenic enlargementsSplenomegaly results from congestion of the cords of Billroth and increased numbers of phagocytes needed to clear the spherocytes.Clinical FeaturesThe diagnosis is based on family history, hematologic findings, and laboratory evidence.In two thirds of the patients the red cells are abnormally sensitive to osmotic lysis when incubated in hypotonic salt solutions, which causes the influx of water into spherocytes with little margin for expansion.HS red cells also have an increased mean cell hemoglobin concentration, due to dehydration caused by the loss of K+ and H2O.The characteristic clinical features are anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice.The generally stable clinical course is sometimes punctuated by aplastic crises, usually triggered by an acute parvovirus infection.Parvovirus infects and kills red cell progenitors, causing red cell production to cease until an effective immune response commences, generally in 1 to 2 weeks.Because of the reduced life span of HS red cells, cessation of erythropoiesis for even short time periods leads to sudden worsening of the anemia.Transfusions may be necessary to support the patient until the immune response clears the infection.Hemolytic crises are produced by intercurrent events leading to increased splenic destruction of red cells (e.g., infectious mononucleosis); these are clinically less significant than aplastic crises.Gallstones, found in many patients, can also produce symptoms.Splenectomy treats the anemia and its complications, but brings with it the risk of sepsis.

The simplest in concept and execution is the cross-sectional study. In this, a set of individuals are chosen who may be a representative sample of the general population or of people in a particular community or a sample of members of some special subgroup - school children, the armed forces, workers in a particular industry, etc. The measurements of exposure and effect are made at the same time providing information on the relationship between a disease and other variables of interest, as they exist at one point of time. Cross-sectional studies are relatively easy and economical to carry out.

Which of the following organisms is the most likely pathogen in this case?,Candida albicans,Giardia lamblia,Haemophilus influenzae,Pneumocystis carinii,3,multi,"The organism described is Pneumocystis carinii, which is an oppounistic parasite that appears to be more closely related to fungi than to protozoa. Its cyst form, when stained with silver stains, has the distinctive appearance described in the question stem, and is typically found in frothy material that occupies the lumen of alveoli. The trophozoites are smaller and much harder to recognize. Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered much more reliable than induced sputum as a diagnostic specimen. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a common infection among AIDS patients, and is very uncommon in other clinical settings. Formerly, many AIDS patients died with Pneumocystis pneumonia, but the combination of early drug treatment (with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine) and prophylaxis (usually with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) has decreased the number of fatal infections. In severe cases, Pneumocystis infection can sometimes be demonstrated in extrapulmonary sites. Candida albicans(choice A) can infect the lung and stain with methenamine silver, but the description of the lavage material would probably include the terms fungal hyphae and yeast forms.

It also tends to form thin adherent oxides that are required to promote atomic bonding of porcelain. 
Base metal alloys containing both beryllium and nickel exhibit high beryllium release rates, which may pose a health risk.
Beryllium-containing particles that are inhaled and reach the alveoli of the lungs may cause a chronic inflammatory condition called berylliosis. 
Berylliosis occurs only in individuals with a hypersensitivity to beryllium and may occur from inhalation of beryllium dusts (from grinding or polishing alloys), salts, or fumes such as those encountered in casting beryllium-containing alloys. Thus, dental lab technicians would presumably be at the highest risk of adverse effects from exposure to beryllium dusts and vapors.

Dooo- needle time should be  30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (50-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists 90 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp  100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation  90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp  95 mmHg, hea rate  50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",Medicine,C.V.S

The condition is most commonly seen as a side effect of medication, most notably antipsychotic medication and intracavernosal injections, but it can also arise as complication of a hypercoagulable blood disorders such as sickle cell disease or leukaemia. A tiny propoion of cases are caused by malignant disease in the corpora cavernosa or the pelvis. The clinical features are of a painful erection not involving the glans penis. Blood taken from the penis shows hypoxia, hyercapnoea and acidosis, while Doppler scanning shows an absence of blood flow within the penis. An underlying cause should be excluded and the patient should be referred for specialist urological care. Treatment is an emergency, since delay beyond 6 hours results in progressive, irreversible damage to the corpus cavernosal tissue with subsequent fibrosis and ED. Aspiration of the sludged blood in the corpora cavernosa is the first-line therapy but if this fails, then intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine (an alpha adrenoceptor agonist) is the next line of therapy. If that proves ineffective, it may be necessary to decompress the penis by creating a shunt between the corpus cavernosum and either the glans penis or the corpus spongiosum. Treatment initiated after 24-36 hours rarely restores normal erectile function. NON-ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM This rarer form of priapism arises as a consequence of traumatic damage to the central penile aery, usually as a consequence of blunt perineal trauma. A fistula develops between the aery and the sinusoidal space, which results in a persistent erection that is painless, in contrast to the ischaemic priapism. Blood gas analysis shows the characteristics of aerial blood and Doppler scanning and selective aeriography will demonstrate the fistula. Treatment is not an emergency, since there is no ischaemia, and is most appropriate achieved by selective aerial embolisation. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1491",Surgery,Urology
